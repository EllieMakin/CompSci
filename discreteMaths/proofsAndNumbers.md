### 1.1. Basic exercises

Prove or disprove the following statements:

1. Suppose $n$ is a natural number larger than 2, and $n$ is not a prime number. Then $2 \cdot n + 13$ is not a prime number.

$2 \cdot 9 + 13 = 31$, which is prime, so the statement is false.

2. If $x^2 + y = 13$ and $y \ne 4$ then $x \ne 3$.

Assume $x^2 + y = 13$, $y \ne 4$ and $x = 3$.

$x^2 + y = 3^2 + y = 9+y = 13$, so $y=4$

$y = 4 \Rightarrow\Leftarrow y \ne 4$

$\therefore x \ne 3$
