```ocaml
type tree =
    | Oak
    | Birch
    | Maple
    | Species of string
;;
```

b) (i)
```ocaml
let describe t =
    match t with
    | Oak -> "oak"
    | Birch -> "birch"
    | Maple -> "maple"
    | Species (name) -> name
;;
```

(ii)
```ocaml
let identify s =
    match s with
    | "oak" -> Oak
    | "birch" -> Birch
    | "maple" -> Maple
    | _ -> Species (s)
;;
```

For the `describe` function, the compiler needs to check that all inputs of type `tree` and handled. Oak, birch, and maple can just be checked one by one. `Species` must be handled for all string values, but this can be checked easily since the pattern in the function matches all strings.

For the `identify` function, the compiler needs to check that all string inputs are handled. This can be easily checked since the wildcard pattern is used which will match any string.

c)
```ocaml
type stree =
    | Oak
    | Birch
    | Maple
;;

exception UnknownTree
let identify_exn s =
    match s with
    | "oak" -> Oak
    | "birch" -> Birch
    | "maple" -> Maple
    | _ -> raise UnknownTree
;;

let identify_opt s =
    match s with
    | "oak" -> Some (Oak)
    | "birch" -> Some (Birch)
    | "maple" -> Some (Maple)
    | _ -> None
;;
```

Throwing an exception is a good idea if the program does not expect a new type of tree ever, i.e. the program is somehow broken if a new tree type is passed to the identifier.

If the program is expecting new types of trees, but doesn't want to do anything with them, then the `option` version is more suitable.

d) (i)
```ocaml
let spotter =
    let seq = [|Oak; Birch; Oak; Maple; Maple|]
    and index = ref 4
    in let get () =
        index := (!index + 1) mod 5;
        Array.get seq !index
    in
    get
;;
```

(ii)
```ocaml
let spotter =
    let seq = [Oak; Birch; Oak; Maple; Maple]
    in let get completeSeq =
        let rec helpGet input matchSeq =
            match (input, matchSeq) with
            | (x::xs, y::ys) -> helpGet xs ys
            | ([], y::ys) -> y
            | (xs, []) -> helpGet xs seq
        in
        helpGet completeSeq seq
    in
    get
;;
```

```ocaml
let s = spotter;;

s [Oak; Birch; Oak; Maple; Maple; Oak];;
(* Output: Birch *)
```
