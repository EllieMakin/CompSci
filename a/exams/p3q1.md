```sql
select R.sid as sid, Q.uid as uid
    from R
    join Q on R.tid = Q.tid
;
```

b)

```sql
select S.A as A, U.C as C
    from S
    join R on S.sid = R.sid
    join Q on R.tid = Q.tid
    join U on Q.uid = U.uid
;
```

c) If some `sid`s recorded in `R` were not actually records of `S`, then the first query would return results from `sid`s which do not exist in `S`, but the second query would only return those which correspond to actual records in `S`. The same applies to those `uid`s recorded in `Q` which do not exist in `U`.

d) If some of the `A`-`C` pairs were the same for different `sid`-`uid` pairs, then the first query might return more, since the duplicated pairs would be ignored, but the distinct `sid` -`uid` pairs would still be returned.

e)

```sql
select Q.tid as tid, count(*) as total
from (
    select R.sid as sid, R.tid as tid, Q.uid as uid
    from R
    join Q on R.tid = Q.tid
)
;
```
