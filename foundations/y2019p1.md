# COMPUTER SCIENCE TRIPOS Part IA - 2019 - Paper 1

## Question 1

*Three alternative representations for non-negative integers, `n`, are:*

- *Peano: values have the form `S(... S(Z) ...)`, applying `S` `n` times to `Z` where `S` and `Z` are constructors or constants of some data type.*

- *Binary: values are of type `bool list` with `0` being represented as the empty list, and the least-significant bit being stored in the head of the list.*

- *Church: values have the form `fn f => fn x => f(... f(x) ...)`, applying `f` `n` times to `x`.*

*a) Write ML functions for each of these data types which take the representation of an integer `n` as argument and return `n` as an ML `int`. [6 marks]*

```ocaml
type peano =
    | Z
    | S of peano
;;

type binary =
    bool list
;;

type 'a church =
    | X of 'a
    | F of (unit -> 'a church)
;;

let rec intFromPeano p =
    match p with
    | Z -> 0
    | S (pn) -> 1 + intFromPeano pn
;;

let rec intFromBinary b =
    match b with
    | [] -> 0
    | d::ds ->
        (if d then 1 else 0) + 2 * (intFromBinary ds)
;;

let rec intFromChurch c =
    match c with
    | X (_) -> 0
    | F (f) -> 1 + (intFromChurch (f ()))
;;
```

*b) Write ML functions for each of these data types which take representations of integers `m` and `n` and return the representation of `m + n`. Your answers must not use any value or operation on type `int` or `real`. [Hint: you might find it useful to write a function `majority: bool * bool * bool -> bool` (which returns true when two or more of its arguments are true) and to note that the ML inequality operator `<>` acts as exclusive-or on `bool`.] [10 marks]*

```ocaml
let rec addPeano m n =
    match m with
    | Z -> n
    | S(m1) -> addPeano m1 (S (n))
;;

let rec addBinary m n =
    let rec subAddBinary x y cIn =
        let a = if x = [] then [false] else x
        and b = if y = [] then [false] else y
        in
        if x = [] && y = [] then
            [cIn]
        else
            match a, b with
            | x0::xs, y0::ys ->
                let sum = x0 <> y0 <> cIn
                and cOut = (x0 && y0) || (x0 && cIn) || (y0 && cIn)
                in
                sum :: (subAddBinary xs ys cOut)
            | _, _ -> []
    in
    subAddBinary m n false
;;

let rec addChurch m n =
    match m with
    | X(_) -> n
    | F(f) -> addChurch (f ()) (F(fun () -> n))
;;
```

*c) Letting `two` and `three` respectively be the Church representations of integers `2` and `3`, indicate whether  each of the following ML expressions give a Church representation of some integer and, if so what integer is represented, and if not giving a one-line reason. [4 marks]*

*(i) `two three`*

This is equal to `f(f(x)) f(f(f(x)))`, which is not a valid Church representation.

*(ii) `three two`*

This is equal to `f(f(f(x))) f(f(x))`, which is not a valid Church representation.

*(iii) `two◦three`*

This is equal to `f(f( f(f(f(x))) )) = 5` in Church representation.

*(iv) `three◦two`*

This is equal to `f(f(f( f(f(x)) ))) = 5` in Church representation.

## Question 2

*We are interested in performing operations on nested lists of integers in ML. A nested list is a list that can contain further nested lists, or integers. For example: `[[3, 4], 5, [6, [7], 8], []]`. We will use the datatype:*

```ocaml
type nested_list = Atom of int
    | Nest of nested_list list;
```

*a) Write the code that creates a value of the type `nested_list` above. [1 mark]*

```ocaml
let n = Nest([
    Nest([
        Atom 3;
        Atom 4
    ]);
    Atom 5;
    Nest([
        Atom 6;
        Nest([
            Atom 7
        ]);
        Atom 8
    ]);
    Nest([])
])
;;
```

*b) Write the function `flatten` that flattens a nested list to return a list of integers. [3 marks]*

```ocaml
let rec flatten nl =
    match nl with
    | Atom (i) -> [i]
    | Nest ([]) -> []
    | Nest (n::ns) ->
        (flatten n) @ (flatten (Nest(ns)))
;;
```

*c) Write the function `nested_map f n` that applies a function `f` to every `Atom` in `n`. [4 marks]*

```ocaml
let rec nested_map f n =
    match n with
    | Atom(i) -> Atom (f i)
    | Nest([]) -> Nest([])
    | Nest(n0::ns) ->
        Nest((nested_map f n0) :: (List.map (nested_map f) ns))
;;
```

*d) What is the type of `f` in Part (c)? [1 mark]*

`int -> int`

*e) Write a function `pack_as xs n` that takes a list of integers and a `nested_list`; the function should return a  new `nested_list` with the same structure as `n`, with integers that correspond to the integers in list `xs`. Note: It is acceptable for the function to fail when the number of elements differ. Example:*

```ocaml
> pack_as [1, 2, 3] (Nest [Atom 9, Nest [Atom 8, Atom 7]]);
val it = Nest [Atom 1, Nest [Atom 2, Atom 3]]: nested_list
```
*\[6 marks]*

```ocaml
let rec pack_as x y =
    let rec subPack r l nl =
        match nl with
        | Atom(i) ->
            r := !r + 1;
            Atom(List.nth l !r)
        | Nest([]) -> Nest([])
        | Nest(n0::ns) ->
            let packed0 = subPack r l n0
            in
            Nest(packed0 :: (List.map (subPack r l) ns))
    and j = ref (~-1)
    in
    subPack j x y
;;
```

*f) What does the data type `nested_zlist` correspond to?*

```ocaml
type nested_zlist = ZAtom of int
    | ZNest of (unit -> nested_zlist list);
```
*\[2 marks]*

A lazy nested list.

*g) Write the function that converts a `nested_zlist` to a `nested_list`. [3 marks]*

```ocaml
let rec zlistToNlist zl =
    match zl with
    | ZAtom(i) -> Atom(i)
    | ZNest(f) -> Nest(List.map zlistToNlist (f ()))
;;
```
